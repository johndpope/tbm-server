Elastic Beanstalk Installation Of TBM using RDS
===============================================



Deployment steps creating a new RDS created by EB and new EB environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For dev servers

Elastic Beanstalk
  - application 
    - use zazo-dev
  
  - Environment
    - use zazo-devn-n where n-nn is the version of the server (zazo-dev1-40)
    - For a simple change to the server where existing clients will still work do not change the version number just ob-deploy to the right environment.
    - For a change that where you want to keep the old environment running for legacy dev clients create a new environment with a new version.

RDS
  - Instance zazo-dev
    - This instance was created with security group open-ssh and publicly accessible to allow access with mysql client remotely through ssh.
    - To access: mysql -h zazo-dev.czebeq6fsif6.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u admin -p
                 pw = Statorama1
    - database.yml
      production:
        adapter: mysql2
        encoding: utf8
        database: zazo_dev_1_4
        username: admin
        password: Statorama1
        host: zazo-dev.czebeq6fsif6.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
        port: 3306
        
  - If a deployment does not requires no change to the database or a migration that can be done on the current existing database without affecting existing clients on an older environment 
    - just deploy without touching database.yml
    
  - If a deployment requires a change to the database that cannot be done as a migration to existing db or is not backwards compatible with another environment that we want to preserve
    - Create a new database on the instance:
      - log in using mysql per above.
      - database create zazo_dev_n_n
      - Change database.yml to point to that database.
      - When you do eb deploy it will run a migration on that fresh db and use it.

  - Make sure you grant permission to IAM user for the contents of the bucket rather than the bucket. videos.zazo.com/*

Problems and solutions
----------------------

PROBLEM: Installed old version of awsebcli. When I upgraded it to 3.6 I ran into and solved the following problems:
  - Using macports version of python on my machine
  - First try did not use macports version of pip. 
    - SOLUTION install macports version of pip. http://truongtx.me/2014/02/25/mac-os-install-python-pip-virtualenv-using-macports/
  - Then could not find the eb command.
    - SOLUTION found it in the awsebcli source code and manually put the file in /opt/local/bin
  
PROBLEM: bundle failing on elastic beanstalk
REASON: We are installing gems using git from our own private repos the ec2 instance does not have git.
SOLUTION: Work around here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13642171/elastic-beanstalk-ruby-rails-need-to-install-git-so-bundle-install-works-but-i
You can do this by setting the BUNDLE_DISABLE_SHARED_GEMS Bundler environment variable in your existing .ebextensions/ruby.config file like so:
  option_settings:
    - option_name: BUNDLE_DISABLE_SHARED_GEMS
      value: "1"
    - option_name: BUNDLE_PATH
      value: "vendor/bundle"

  packages:
    yum:
      git: []

PROBLEM: Rake migrate was failing. 
REASON: Above failure in running bundle was preventing rake from being there.

QUESTION: How to associate an eb deployment with an already running RDS instance?
http://serverfault.com/questions/540828/how-to-associate-an-existing-rds-instance-to-an-elastic-beanstalk-environment


USEFUL:
curl canhazip.com to check the outgoing ip from a server.


PROBLEM: GCM whitelists ip addresses. Each ec2 instance has a separate ip address. 
SOLUTION: ? use a NAT? http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html ?
